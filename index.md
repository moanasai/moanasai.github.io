  <h1> Everything About Ducks </h1>
      <h4> Today, I'm going to take you through a journey of <em>discovery</em>, of wonder, and the truly awe-inspiring world of the creatures we know as ducks. </h4>
    
  <h2> Ducks - The Dictionary Definition </h2>
      <p> Ducks are a group of water birds - not a mammal, not an amphibian, but classified as <i> birds </i>. 
	With their small, webbed feet, these relatively short creatures are short-necked, but have beaks as large as their hearts (metaphorically of course,
	ducks have relatively small hearts, but that doesn't mean they don't have love!). In other words, they have large beaks, 
	and even larger wings. Their magestic plumage unfortunately doesn't contribute to their flying ability, but few species DID retain the ability to, 
	<b>spreading their wings and soaring into the sunset</b> (or waddling around on the grass too!).  </p>

  <h3> Different Duck Species </h3> 
	<p> There are many different types of ducks, but I'm going to explain the typical ones we see!</p>
	<ul> 
	        <l> <b>Mallards: </b> </l> 
		<p> the most common type of ducks - typically aggressive. Only the male mallards have the shiny green plumage on their head, while the females are typically brown and dull. </p>
		<l> <b> American Pekin: </b></l>
		<p> an American breed of domestic birds primarily raised for poultry. They are more docile and friendly than Mallards, and make great household pets!</p>
		<l> <b>Indian Runner Ducks: </b></l>
		<p> noticable for their unbelievably long necks. They look like they were horizontally stretched out, and instead of waddling, they run! </p>
		<l><b> Crested Ducks:</b> </l>
		<p> another type of domestic duck, but is characterized by the large fluff of feathers on its head, making it look like Albert Einstein. This breed is known to be very cool. </p>
		<l> <b>Pomeranian Duck: </b></l>
		<p> another domesticated duck, this breed is especially rare. They are traditionally black or dark blue, which a white breastplate - and their eyes are incredibly adorable. </p>
	</ul>

  <div>  <h2> The <b>Brief </b>History of Ducks </h2>
  	<p> Ducks can be traced back to the Neolithic period, domesticated in China and other places in East Asia. The oldest descendant is known to be the Mallard (<i> Anas platyrhynchos</i>). </p>
        <p> They were also seen in Ancient Egypt and Europe nearly 4000 years ago. In order to bring them to the United States, they were imported from China and Europe.</p>
        <p> The duck population grew rapidly to what we see today - parks filled with these feathery, fun-filled buddies who occasionally poop on us and eat our breadcrumbs. </p>
