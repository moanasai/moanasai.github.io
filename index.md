  <h1> Everything About Ducks </h1>
      <h4> Today, I'm going to take you through a journey of <em>discovery</em>, of wonder, and the truly awe-inspiring world of the creatures we know as ducks. </h4>
    
  <h2> Ducks - The Dictionary Definition </h2>
      <p> Ducks are a group of water birds - not a mammal, not an amphibian, but classified as <i> birds </i>. 
				They are relatively short, and short-necked, but have beaks as large as their hearts (metaphorically of course,
				ducks have relatively small hearts, but that doesn't mean they don't have love!). In other words, they have large beaks, 
				and even larger wings. Their magestic plumage doesn't mean they can fly per se, but few species DID retain the ability to, 
				<b>spreading their wings and soaring into the sunset.</b>  </p>
    
  <h3> Different Duck Species </h3> 
		<p> There are many different types of ducks, but I'm going to explain the typical ones we see!</p>
		<ul> 
			<l> <b>Mallards: </b> </l> 
			<p> the most common type of ducks - typically aggressive. 
				Only the male mallards have the shiny green plumage on their head, while the females are typically brown and dull. </p>
			<l> < b>American Pekin: </b></l>
			<p> an American breed of domestic birds primarily raised for poultry. They are more docile and friendly than Mallards, and make great household pets!</p>
			<l> <b>Indian Runner Ducks: </b></l>
			<p> noticable for their unbelievably long necks. They look like they were horizontally stretched out, and instead of waddling, they run! </p>
			<l><b> Crested Ducks:</b> </l>
			<p> another type of domestic duck, but is characterized by the large fluff of feathers on its head, making it look like Albert Einstein. This breed is known to be very cool. </p>
			<l> <b>Pomeranian Duck: </b></l>
			<p> another domesticated duck, this breed is especially rare. They are traditionally black or dark blue, which a white breastplate - and their eyes are incredibly adorable. </p>
